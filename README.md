# Combo Universal — Flutter Android App

Offline-first universal compatibility list (combo/display, battery, tempered glass, CC board, frame) for mobile repair technicians. Companion app for [combouniversal.com](https://combouniversal.com/) and [combosupport.in](https://combosupport.in/).

## Features
- **Smart highlight search** across every category at once, with debounce and exact-match ranking (same behaviour as the website).
- **Hybrid data**: ships with a bundled JSON catalog (works offline, instantly), silently upgrades from a remote JSON when a higher `version` is published, and caches it locally.
- Category → brand → list browsing, per-brand filter.
- Save/bookmark lists, recent searches, copy & WhatsApp share of a full list.
- Material 3 UI, dark mode, portrait-locked, no login.
- AdMob adaptive banner + throttled interstitial (1 in 6 navigations), with an in-app personalised-ads toggle.
- In-app privacy policy and disclaimer screens.


**Search that understands how technicians type**
- Ignores spacing and punctuation — `redmi9a`, `Redmi 9-A` and `REDMI  9a` are the same query.
- Brand shorthand and common misspellings are expanded (`rn9pro`, `samsang a10`, `1+`, `moto`).
- Typo tolerance: an exact/substring pass runs first, and only if nothing matches does it fall back to edit-distance matching, so correct spellings never get noisy results.
- Part keywords auto-scope the query — `redmi 9a battery` searches only the Battery category. Filter chips override it.
- Also matches group codes and battery part numbers (`BN4A`, `EB-BA546ABY`).
- "Did you mean" suggestions when nothing matches, and model autocomplete chips above the results.

**Model profile** — tap any model to see every universal part that fits it (combo, battery, glass, board, cover) plus every phone that shares those parts. Share or copy the whole parts sheet.

**Compare models** — add two or more phones and instantly see which categories have a single part covering all of them. Decide what to stock before you buy.

**Order list** — add any part list to a cart, attach a note (price, shelf, supplier), then send the whole order to a supplier over WhatsApp in one tap.

**Browse A–Z** — a filterable index of every distinct model in the catalog, for when you are unsure of the exact spelling.

**Shop notes** — a private, on-device note against any part list.

**Proactive UX** — the home screen reads on-device signals (time of day, repeated searches, a waiting order list) and offers the single most useful next step: resume a job you keep searching, send an order that has been sitting, or compare the two phones you just looked up. At most one suggestion at a time, always dismissible, never nagging. All signals stay on the device.

**Emotionally intelligent copy** — a time-aware greeting, and failure states that name what you typed and offer a route forward instead of a dead end. Haptics form a small vocabulary: selection for navigation, light impact for "added", medium for "removed".

**Motion & 3D** — real perspective transforms (`Matrix4` with a perspective term), not shadows faking depth: cards tilt toward your finger, a lit orb rotates in empty states, and two phone silhouettes swing together with a burst when a shared part is found. Lists cascade in, counters roll up, skeletons shimmer while a search debounces.

**Accessibility** — in-app text size slider (85–150%) layered on top of the system setting, plus dark mode. Everything works fully offline. Every animation honours the OS "reduce motion" setting through a single `Motion.reduced` gate.

**Responsive** — content-driven breakpoints at 600 and 905 logical pixels: one column on phones, two on tablets, with page padding that grows and a max content width so model names never stretch into unreadable lines. Orientation is deliberately unlocked for bench use.

## Design system

**Motion** — one scale in `lib/motion.dart` (90 / 180 / 280 / 460 ms) with
`easeOutCubic` in and `easeInCubic` out, so things leave faster than they
arrive. Nothing exceeds 500 ms: this is a tool used with a customer waiting.
Staggered list entrances cap at 12 items so a 1,000-row list never makes the
user wait for a cascade.

**Depth** — `TiltCard` and `DepthOrb` use genuine perspective matrices with a
moving light source and rim lighting, so surfaces read as lit objects rather
than gradient rectangles. Tilt is capped at ~0.16 rad; a bigger angle reads as
a gimmick and hurts legibility.

**Typography** — three Google Fonts, each doing one job:

| Family | Role | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Sora** | headings, titles, stats | geometric and confident; gives the app its premium, technical feel |
| **Inter** | body, lists, labels | engineered for small sizes and dense UI — this app is mostly lists |
| **JetBrains Mono** | part codes, battery numbers, SKUs | unambiguous `0/O` and `1/l`, which matters when reading `BN4A` off a screen |

The scale in `lib/theme.dart` steps on a ~1.2 ratio with tracking that tightens
as size grows (`-1.2` at display, `+0.6` at label), which is what separates a
designed type system from merely resized text. Line heights are set per role:
1.18 for headings, 1.42 for body.

Fonts are **bundled**, not fetched. `GoogleFonts.config.allowRuntimeFetching`
is off, so the app never makes a network call for type and works fully offline.
Run `bash tools/fetch_fonts.sh` once to populate `assets/google_fonts/`.

**Colour** — a deep indigo-blue brand seed with an amber accent for search
highlights. Each part category carries its own accent (`accentFor`) so the home
grid reads as five distinct destinations: battery green, glass cyan, board
violet, cover pink, display blue.

**Shared primitives** (`lib/widgets/ui.dart`) keep every screen consistent:
`CodeChip` (tap-to-copy monospaced part code), `SoftBadge`, `SectionHeader`,
`EmptyState` and `VerifyNotice`. Spacing uses the `Gap` scale instead of magic
numbers.

The Android splash background is themed light/dark to match the app, so there
is no colour flash on launch.

```

## Run it

Fetch the bundled fonts once before the first build:

```bash
bash tools/fetch_fonts.sh
```

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Point the app at your own remote catalog:
```bash
flutter run --dart-define=CATALOG_URL=https://combouniversal.com/app/catalog.json
```

## Before you publish
1. **AdMob IDs** — replace the test app ID in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and the `real*` unit IDs in `lib/services/ads_service.dart`, then build with `--dart-define=USE_REAL_ADS=true`. Shipping test IDs to production, or real IDs on a dev build, both violate AdMob policy.
2. **Application ID** — currently `com.makund.combouniversal` (`android/app/build.gradle`). The existing Play listing uses `com.makund.combosupport`; use that ID instead if you are updating the same app rather than publishing a new one.
3. **Signing** — create `android/key.properties` (git-ignored) with `storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`.
4. **Icon** — `store/icon_source.png` is a 1024px source; generate launcher densities (e.g. with `flutter_launcher_icons`) into `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`.
5. **Privacy policy URL** — publish `store/PRIVACY_POLICY.md` at a public URL and enter it in Play Console.
6. **Data safety form** — copy the answers in `store/DATA_SAFETY.md`.
7. **App Links** — host `.well-known/assetlinks.json` on combouniversal.com so deep links verify (helps search discoverability).

Build the release bundle:
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=USE_REAL_ADS=true
```

## Publishing catalog updates without an app update
Host a JSON file with the same schema as `assets/data/catalog.json` at `CATALOG_URL`, and bump the top-level `version` integer each time you add models. Users get it on next launch or pull-to-refresh — no Play review needed.

## Policy notes baked in
- Minimal permissions: `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`, `AD_ID`. No location/storage/contacts, no `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`.
- Cleartext traffic disabled; HTTPS-only network security config.
- `targetSdk 35` (meets Play's 2025+ target API requirement).
- Interstitials never appear on app open or back press, and banners render only after load — no accidental clicks.
- Trademark disclaimer for brand names included in the listing and in-app terms.

## Tests
```bash
flutter test
```


## Updating the bundled data

The offline catalog ships with **1,174 universal lists covering 5,675 phone
models** across 5 categories (Combo/Display, Battery, Tempered Glass, CC/Sub
Board, Mobile Cover).

Edit the plain-text sources in `tools/raw/` and regenerate:

```bash
python3 tools/build_catalog.py
```

Formats:

- `combo_*.txt`, `glass_*.txt`, `cc_*.txt`, `case_all.txt` — one group per line,
  models comma separated. Trailing descriptors such as `Punch Hole LCD` are
  detected automatically and stored as the group note.
- `battery_*.txt` — `Battery code|Model, Model, Model` per line.
- Lines starting with `Coming Soon` are skipped.

To push an update without a Play release, host the generated JSON at
`CATALOG_URL` and bump its `version`.
